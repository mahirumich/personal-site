            <p>I'm currently a junior at the
                <a href="https://cse.engin.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a> doing a double major
                in Computer Science and Data Science. My current courses include Web Systems,
                Introduction to Machine Learning, and Introduction to Computer Organization.
                This summer, I'll be working as a Software Engineering Intern at
                <a href="https://www.f5.com/">F5 Networks</a>
                in my hometown of Seattle, Washington.
            </p>
            <p>
              My current interests are software engineering, cloud computing, distributed systems,
              web development, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. I'm also passionate about
              all things data, and believe that when used correctly, the era of big data has the
              potential to inflict positive change in all of our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm experienced in multiple programming languages and frameworks, as well as having a rich
              mathematical background, all of which allows me to solve complex problems. As an engineer, I enjoy
              adapting to new challenges and learning new technologies, and pushing my boundaries in both comfort
              and problem solving. I'm always thinking about the bigger picture, ensuring my products are
              fault-tolerant and secure.
            </p>
            <p><strong>When I'm not in front of my computer screen</strong>, I'm probably watching the Seattle
              Mariners lose another ballgame, out for a run, or spending time with friends and making new memories.
